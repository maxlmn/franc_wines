The nose is intense, with ripe pear aromas, yet also wild and pretty ""natural,"" with flinty tones and remarkable depth and purity. Round, fresh and very elegant on the palate, this is a long and complex, very intense and sustainably salty Chenin with stewed and essential (red-skinned) pear aromas on the mid-palate. The finish is also finely tannic and delivers pastry, some black chocolate and lemon notes. It's an impressive and pretty unique wine from what was formerly a Touraine AOP. I tasted this in June 2021 from a Zalto Universal glass, which is better than any Burgundy glass for this wine because it underlines the purity and mineral freshness rather than the body and opulent texture. Aged in old barriques for 12 months. No added sulfur.",chateau de coulaine

Naturally fermented in concrete and aged in 400-liter barrels for 11 months before bottling, the unified and unfiltered red opens with a pure, intense and elegant nose with perfectly ripe elderberry aromas. Silky, crystalline, fresh and enormously vital, this is a full-bodied, intense and elegant Chinon from a 0.8-hectare plot. The wine has a lot of energy and tension but needs a couple of years to show its class, which is not based on power and intensity but freshness and purity of fruit.

Full-bodied, round and intense on the palate, this is a silky-textured and vital Chinon with fine and ripe tannins and a tart, lemon-bitter and round finish.

The dark fruit aromas are imbedded into a chassis with earthy and spicy flavors. On the palate, this is a full-bodied, round, lush, intense and silky-textured Chinon with lots of power, tight tannins and refreshing mineral acidity. Though it is currently still slightly astringent, the clear, intense and powerful finish also healthy tension for further development. Very concentrated in everything: fruit, acidity, tannins, power and tension. A bit overloaded for now, but the 2018 will show great in a decade. Tasted in June 2021.",chateau de coulaine

It opens with an intense, super ripe and pretty developed bouquet that is a bit too open for my personal tastes and maybe also too rich and intense on the nose. Pure and fresh on the palate but also rich and powerful, this is a massive, numbing yet mineral Chenin that was aged in barriques (20% of which were new) for 11 months, bâtonnage included. My sample bottle is pretty developed and, with all due respect, tastes older than a 2018 should taste. Tasted in June 2021.",chateau de coulaine

It is a full-bodied, supple, dense and well-structured but also elegant and finessed Chenin with a clean, fresh, long, persistently salty and mineral finish. I would recommend giving this expressive wine with its fine yet firm tannins as much time to breathe as possible or to store it for another two or even 10+ years. It's one of the most impressive white wines I have tasted from Touraine.",chateau de coulaine
2016 Chateau de Coulaine Chinon,88,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/B55d8igyYz35jRK2p,"From younger and up to 30-year-old vines planted on loam and limestone soils, the red 2016 Chinon estate wine was fermented in oak and cement and aged for one year. It exhibits a luminous cherry color and opens with a very clear, fresh and fruity/leathery bouquet of sour cherries and red fruit as well as crushed chalk. This is a very distinctive and finessed style! Silky, fresh and beautifully round on the palate, with a charismatic austerity and straightforwardness, this is a medium-bodied, fruity and seriously structured Chinon rouge. The wine has remarkable vitality and finesse and reveals a stimulating, even if somewhat astringent, complex of refreshing acidity and crisp tannins. Jean de Bonnaventure lost 70% of his crop in 2016 due to spring frost, and he said it was difficult to see if the grapes were really ripe during the harvest. In the end, the 2016s had very good acidity and ""sometimes even more than that."" In 2017, when again 70% of the crop was lost, Jean decided to pick a week later to make sure the grapes were all perfectly ripe. Tasted in March 2021.",chateau de coulaine

Dressed in a dark cherry color, the 2015 offers a deep, coolish, fresh and concentrated cassis bouquet with earthy, flinty and some floral aromas as well as raw meat, iron and a dash of mocha. Smooth, round and very elegant on the palate, this is a spicy-peppery, vital and beautifully balanced Chinon with a long, fresh and crisp finish. Stimulating, salty and remarkably fine. This is a great Chinon, and its salty vibrancy is really kicking. You can keep this wine for at least 10 or 20 years. Bottled in December 2017. Tasted back in May 2018.",chateau de coulaine

It is entirely fermented and aged in a 60-hectoliter oak vat and shows nice reduction but also pure and well-concentrated sour cherry fruit. On the palate, this is a concentrated, powerful and densely woven Cabernet with terroir expression and fine and crisp tannins. It is elegant and fresh but even more steely and firm than the estate Chinon. The finish is enormously salty, sharp and crisp, thanks to the tannins and the soil, which is in fact pretty deep loam here.",chateau de coulaine

Intensely yellow in color and flavors (think of crushed tuff, limestone and concentrated Chenin berries), this is a rich and elegant, very concentrated and powerful but well-balanced Chenin with firm but restrictive tannins on the finish. However, this 2015 was still terribly young and needed time to integrate all its elements when I tasted it in 2018, yet the aging potential promised to be very good.",chateau de coulaine

It fermented in old concrete vats, then aged for one year in 400-liter barrels and for another six months in 60-hectoliter oak vats. The bouquet needs some time to open up, but it is generously ripe but also coolish, fresh and elegant, representing a very classic, old-school style with some overripe and leathery fruit aromas. Silky, pure and fresh on the palate, this is a full-bodied yet silky Cabernet Franc with lots of tension and mineral vibrancy on the finish. It is a powerful yet fresh and expressive wine. It should age very well for 20 or 30 years, perhaps even more. Bottled in spring 2016. 12.5% alcohol.",chateau de coulaine

Round and intense on the palate, with a very elegant texture and refreshing mousse, this is a remarkably elegant and persistent méthode traditionnelle that was disgorged in July 2015. The wine has the ripe and delicate fruit of Chenin as well as the elegance and freshness from the calcareous soil around the château in Beaumont-en-Veron, which is located in the Chinon area.

Very long and powerful, this is structured by very fine but firm tannins and carried forward by an exciting salty-mineral finish. A mind-blowing Chinon that is still in the middle of nowhere. Served from the carafe, the wine is even more pure, floral and flinty as well as very elegant and distinctive.

Beet root and subtly bitter floral and coffee notes join in on the dense, smooth, polished palate. Hints of iodine, salt and a faintly tart fresh black fruit edge enliven the wine’s restrained finish. This is a lovely example of the virtues of ripe Franc. I found a couple of Coulaine cuvees from 2003 and 2004 notably less convincing, and did not have opportunity to taste their premium 2005 vintage bottlings.
