The 2021 Savennières-Roche aux Moines possesses a deep, wild bouquet with aromas of fennel, spices, pear and caramel intertwined with lactic notes with aeration. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and balanced, it’s satiny with a phenolic, long finish. Although it lacks depth and precision, it remains a good effort, given the vintage.",domaine aux moines

Medium to full-bodied, fleshier and juicier than the 2019 vintage, it’s enveloping and round, with a mineral tension in the mid-palate and a penetrating, long finish. It will offer a broad drinking window.",domaine aux moines

Medium-bodied, gourmand and enveloping, it has a fresh core of fruit with bright acids on the finish. The floral aftertaste is certainly due to a gentle touch of residual sugar.",domaine aux moines

Medium-bodied, juicy and slightly fleshy, it’s round and enveloping with a charming, ethereal, racy finish enhanced by elegantly menthol notes.",domaine aux moines
2015 Domaine Aux Moines Savennières-Roche aux Moines,91,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/Z8bkTPrmLBWAE9v89,"The 2015 Savennières-Roche aux Moines from Tessa Laroche reveals a shy, elegant bouquet with aromas of spices, herbs, pear and hay. Moderately weighted, incisive and tense, it’s elegant with bright acids despite an austere finish. This vintage can be approached with pleasure even if it has three to five years of evolution ahead of it.",domaine aux moines
2016 Domaine Aux Moines Savennières-Roche aux Moines,93,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/bEq7SaQ6PBjBaNu6P,"The 2016 Savennières-Roche aux Moines displays a very clear, bright, fresh and elegant bouquet of white fruit aromas intertwined with slatey ones. On the palate, this is a very delicate, elegant and even lifted Roche aux Moines with good tension, very fine tannins and lovely freshness and finesse in the long and incredibly bright finish. Bottled in March 2018. (The bottling date—280318—is printed on the bottle, although each wine has just one or two consecutive bottling days).",domaine aux moines
2016 Domaine Aux Moines Savennières-Roche aux Moines Doux Cuvée de l’Abbesse,90,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/mLa7uQLZCd7btkBXo,"The bright colored 2016 Savennières-Roche aux Moines Doux Cuvée de l’Abbesse is a wonderfully fruity and well-concentrated Chenin with delicate slate aromas on the nose, with stewed apricots and peaches. Intense and juicy on the palate, with ripe and cooked peach and apricot flavors, this has beautiful vitality and mineral finesse and a good mineral and even tannic structure. The grapes were picked at the beginning of October, after the grapes for the dry wine. The Doux was fermented and aged in two-year-old 220-liter barrels for one year. Tessa Laroche didn't add any sulfites (there are 60 milligrams per liter of total SO2) before the bottling after 13 months. The 2016 contains 98 grams per liter of residual sugar and a pH of 3. Tasted at the domaine in May 2018.",domaine aux moines
2016 Domaine Aux Moines Anjou-Villages,89,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/G3pDJW4fZsJk3P6L2,"The red 2016 Anjou-Villages is a lovely Cabernet Franc/Cabernet Sauvignon (70/30) from 97-year-old vines cultivated on schist gréseux (sandstone) at the domaine and with a great view of the Loire River. The wine is a beautifully dark and aromatic Cabernet with dense yet elegant and pure fruit, floral and even slatey aromas. The palate is charming, fresh and dry, well-structured and with lingering salinity and tension on the finish. It’s not a big or bold Cab but elegant, fine and fresh, with intense and fleshy fruit, juicy tannins and great charm. Just beautiful and still slightly reductive. The schist soils give a nice nervosity here. Unfortunately, it will be one of the last red wines produced by Tessa Laroche. She has serious thoughts of replanting the plot with Chenin Blanc. The grapes were destemmed by hand and crushed by Tessa’s hands. The maceration in stainless steel took four weeks, with no remontage and no pigèage applied. The wine aged for 14 months in stainless steel and was bottled in January 2017. Total production: 4,000 bottles—""more or less for my own consumption,"" Tessa said with a wink. Tasted in May 2018.",domaine aux moines
2014 Domaine Aux Moines Savennières-Roche aux Moines,93+,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/Gtt3bNaHHDfpuz5kg,"The 2014 Savennières-Roche aux Moines is from a good but not exceptional year. The wine offers an intense and concentrated yet not very fruity bouquet. The palate is very elegant and fine, well balanced and pure, and the finish is very long, elegant and salty, with some tannins crossing the way. All in all you, get the coolish terroir here and the good vintage that delivers ripe and concentrated fruits with good tannin structure. This is an excellent Roche aux Moines that is still on its way. Tessa Laroche said: ""We started picking our grapes earlier; in 2014, it was end of September. I was aiming for more purity, freshness and digestibility. I don't want to wait for my wines that long; they should be exceptional all the time, whenever you open a bottle. 2012 was too big for me, too powerful. So, I started to change my style with the 2013 vintage and then especially from 2014 onward. In the vineyard, we work the soils more than before; we have more life in the soil. And we do a green harvest in July.""",domaine aux moines
2013 Domaine Aux Moines Savennières-Roche aux Moines,91,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/vmeas4BPxSYkjGueN,"The Domaine aux Moines 2013 Savennières-Roche aux Moines has an intense citrus color and opens with some Fino aromas before the terroir shines through along with very fine, small yellow fruit and citrus tea aromas. Very elegant and rather light on the palate, this is a lean, fresh and linear Roche aux Moines that reveals its tannins only in the nicely salty finish. It is by far not as big as 2014 or 2015 but a very nice and characterful wine that needs some years to reach its best condition, although it will always remain a more austere Chenin compared to the other vintages. Tasted in May 2018 at the domaine. Tessa Laroche said: ""2013 was a very cold year, so we waited a long time to start harvesting because we need 12.5% alcohol to market the wine under the Savennières-Roche aux Moines AC. In the end, we picked the grapes on 6th/7th October. I don’t know yet if it has been a good idea. We discharged all the botrytis grapes, but the fermentation was not that easy. It was simply too cold. However, the wine was fermented to dry on Christmas. Since then, we never got any fruit flavors from the 2013. Only now is it starting to give some flavors...""",domaine aux moines
2012 Domaine Aux Moines Savennières-Roche aux Moines,92,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/7GPvQiRPb7gKh6EpA,"The Domaine aux Moines 2012 Savennières-Roche aux Moines displays a golden-yellow color and an intense and concentrated but at the moment somewhat shy and diffuse nose with ripe but also nutty fruit aromas. The palate is rich and creamy, very powerful and intense, with good concentration and a long and aromatic yet slightly bitter and astringent finish. The 2012 needs another couple of years to improve, though the remaining question is if the astringency will disappear. Tasted at the domaine in May 2018. ""It was raining all the time in 2012, and we lost a lot,"" said Tessa Laroche, who yielded only 12 hectoliters per hectare that year. ""We had to wait to get those golden-yellow grapes we were aiming for at that time, so we harvested at the end of October, and we still accepted botrytis at that time. We should have about 20% of noble rot here.“",domaine aux moines
2011 Domaine Aux Moines Savennieres Roche Aux Moines,95,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/9wde6tKJLpDQLtGXc,"The golden colored 2011 Savennieres Roche Aux Moines is richer and even more intense than the 2012 but – at least initially – less brilliant when I tasted it in August this year. The (dried) fruit is less upfront here, since there are smoky as well as spicy biscuit aromas dominating the nose instead. Several minutes later there are refreshing lime and floral aromas, too. This wine would definitely benefit from some hours in the decanter also because it is an enormously powerful, fiery, and structured wine with a richness and salinity that almost reminds of Pineau de Charentes, white Port or other fortified wines. The palate is rich, intense, and round, quite glycerin-like, and the finish is outstanding, intense and long but also elegant and vivacious. This is a great and potent wine for many years and any Chenin supporter should have some bottles in the cellar.",domaine aux moines
1999 Domaine Aux Moines Savennieres Roche Aux Moines,86?,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/YD3rijMaL49tZSJzP,"The 1999 Savennieres Roche aux Moines is a respectable wine, though by far not as brilliant and precise as it is now. The selection of the grapes is obviously much more careful today. The 1999 offers some fungal aromas beside matured flavors of dried fruits, caramel, and slate. The palate is almost dry and dominated by the dried apricot fruit, but the finish remains somewhat rough and bitter. This was probably not the best bottle?",domaine aux moines
2006 Domaine Aux Moines Savennieres Roche Aux Moines,87,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/EKnYzeaY3xGBkAg84,"The wines are also released at a leisurely pace, so that Domaine Aux Moines’s 2006 Savennieres - Roche Aux Moines represents their current release. In a sadly vintage-typical manner, this wine is challenged by prickly heat of (as per the label) 14.5% alcohol and prickly notes of incipient botrytis bitterness. That said, it nonetheless offers a fascinating combination of peach, citrus oils, raw mushroom, and alkaline, wet stone suggestions of things mineral. In the mouth, this is richly peachy with prominent citrus oil and peach kernel bitterness. It preserves more than a modicum of fresh fruit juiciness, but too little to entirely override the wine’s finishing heat. Perhaps time will be easier on the Savennieres of this vintage than I am prepared to be now, but I would plan to serve this wine over the next couple of years. The mother-daughter team of Monique and Teresa Laroche craft some of their regions classics, which they continue to sell at prices that belie their quality much less their officially premier cru status.

2001 Domaine Aux Moines Savennieres Roche Aux Moines,90,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/sriRbAZm9pXLmFjvZ,"While the Laroches’ wonderful 2002 (reviewed in issue 172) was still available from them 7 or more years after its vintage, they have now also offered – at negligible premium in price! – their 2001 Savennieres - Roche Aux Moines, a much better-balanced and for them more typical wine than their 2006. Mysteriously saline, alkaline, musky, mossy, truffly, stale bread-, lichen-, kelp- and iris-like in the nose, this offers opulent texture and alcoholic body with scant heat and without disturbing the fascinating array of marine, forest floor, and stony nuances that parade into a long finish. Yes, there is a sense of fruit here: principally peach and passion fruit, with fruit pit bitterness adding persistent piquancy. But this is above all about rocks, trees, and stuff that grow on them. It should be fascinating to follow for another several years, although it already displays a mature array of flavors.

2004 Domaine Aux Moines Savennieres Roche Aux Moines,90,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/gFXeMrG5powjS5jhT,"The mother-daughter team of Monique and Tessa Laroche keeps to a time-honored (and until the last 10-15 years, still widespread) Loire tradition of releasing wines only after some bottle age, as well as of offering selected older vintages. Their 2004 Savennieres - Roche Aux Moines delivers a pungent opening salvo of radish, lime zest, quarry dust, and white pepper, then saturates the palate with a palpably dense, creamy, yet bracingly high-acid matrix of quince paste and salty, stony mineral dust, then leaves the palate utterly stained with walnut, peach kernel, salt, and stone. Follow this for a decade or more: the 1994 is still available and its truffly, nutty, minerally-intense performance is riveting. Importer: WineWise, Oakland, CA 94618; tel.

2002 Domaine Aux Moines Savennieres Roche Aux Moines,93,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/T9veYPQMtNuKJmTSf,"The mother-daughter team of Monique and Tessa Laroche keeps to a time-honored (and until the last 10-15 years, still widespread) Loire tradition of releasing wines only after some bottle age, as well as of offering selected older vintages. As fine as is their 2004, it will come as no surprise that the Laroche’s 2002 Savennieres - Roche Aux Moines is far better, and indeed a more remarkable value in halfway evolved white wine would be hard to find anywhere on earth save the Loire. (And how can they be charging the same price?!) A gorgeous nose of quince, honey, wet stone and bitter herbs segues into a bracingly-bright, bell-clear palate full of underlying richness (the fruit stretching to encompass pineapple and lime as well as quince) and intense (salty, stony, alkaline) minerality, yet downright refreshing in a way that Savennieres seldom deigns to be. The call and response of fruit and mineral here is as in a great Riesling and there is a sense of lift and primary juiciness that belie the wines 14% alcohol. Above all, there is mystery: a hint of truffle here, striking floral perfume there, and a finish with the depth and minerality of the ocean. Importer: WineWise, Oakland, CA 94618; tel.
