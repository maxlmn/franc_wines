2022 Domaine Théo Blet La Peyanne,93,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/r8ipKnQyDPYdEBo4e/domaine-theo-blet-la-peyanne-2022,"From a tiny parcel, the 2022 La Peyanne offers a pure, delicate and vibrant bouquet of pear, peach, herbs, spring flowers, lemon and menthol. Medium to full-bodied, pure and crystalline, it's dense and layered with perfectly integrated oaky notes, concluding with a long, saline and mineral finish. With only 3,500 bottles produced, this Chenin Blanc stands out as one of the most vibrant and pure expressions of the variety from Saumur today. Théo Blet undoubtedly has emerged as a winemaker worthy of close attention in the years ahead.",domaine theo blet
2022 Domaine Théo Blet Le Corbin,91,https://www.robertparker.com/wines/8JJyJCwCeDfa69GXx/domaine-theo-blet-le-corbin-2022,"Notions of smoke, cassis, dark wild berries, flowers and rose petals introduce the beautiful 2022 Le Corbin from Théo Blet, a well-executed, perfectly balanced wine with a medium-bodied, supple and elegant palate that possesses a juicy core of fruit and delicate tannins. Slightly austere and young, this Cabernet Franc should hit its stride in 2 to 3 years and last for 6 to 8 years. Produced at only 3,500 bottles.",domaine theo blet
